# CS50 TSE - Index Read ME
## Samhitha Vallury - github: samhithavv

TSE indexer is a standalone program that reads the document files produced by the TSE crawler, builds an index, and writes that index to a file. Its companion, the index tester, loads an index file produced by the indexer and saves it to another file.
