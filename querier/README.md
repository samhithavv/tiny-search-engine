# CS50 TSE - Querier README.
## Samhitha Vallury - github: samhithavv

The TSE Querier is a standalone program that reads the index file produced by the TSE Indexer, and page files produced by the TSE Querier, and answers search queries submitted via stdin.


No assumptions were made beyond the ones in the assignment.

Notes: Have to run compile fuzzquery (make fuzzquery) in order to use fuzzquery testing
