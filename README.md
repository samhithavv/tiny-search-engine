The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA24/labs/tse).
Do not clone that repo; view it on GitHub.
Watch there for any commits that may represent updates to the assignment or specs.

Add here any assumptions you made while writing the crawler, any ways in which your implementation differs from the three Specs, or any ways in which you know your implementation fails to work.

Crawler: Cntains code for crawler, which goes through a webpage and collects the URLs within it. It will then examine those new URLs depending on the depth. - I made no assumptions beyond the ones included in the instructions. 

Indexer: Contains code for crawler, which goes through output of crawler and then collects words greater than or equal to length and counts how many time it appears in each document. - I made no assumptions beyond the ones included in the instructions. 

Querier:
